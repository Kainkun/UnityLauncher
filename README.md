### Unity Launcher
*This is a PyQt Tool that lists your Unity projects with icons and descriptions!*

### Instructions
1. To install it, download the .zip from the Releases tab and extract the file to wherever you'd like.
2. UnityLauncher.exe runs the tool. I recommend right clicking it and "Send To Desktop" to create a shortcut.
3. To start using Unity Launcher, click "Settings" on the top left and add your projects folder and your Unity editors folder.

## Development
To build the executable files from source, run **BuildOneDir.bat**.
These scripts will compile the project to a folder named "build".

If you make any changes to the UI via Qt Designer, make sure to run the **Generate.ps1** script!
This ensures that corresponding "generated/*.py" files are kept up to date, which is used by the code.
