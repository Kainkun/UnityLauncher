### UnityLauncher
*Launcher for Unity that lists your projects with icons and descriptions.*

## Development
To build the executable files from source, run either **BuildOneDir.bat** or **BuildOneFile.bat**.
These scripts will compile the project to folder named "build".

If you make any changes to the UI via Qt Designer, make sure to run the **Generate.ps1** script!
This ensures that corresponding "generated/*.py" files are kept up to date, which is used by the code.
